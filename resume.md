### Takdesk (2018-2019)

* Teamed up with 2 highly skilled developers to ramp up a brand new data platform.
* Designed and developed a high throughput bridge from our core messaging system, RabbitMQ,
to Apache Kafka to support all the required data processing, both in Elixir and Scala.
* Developed a stream processing layer on top of Kafka, providing a set of user-friendly DSLs
to allow other teams apply their own  business logic and deliver high quality read models to be queried by 
multiple systems afterwards.
* Delivered a highly scalable streaming API, written in Elixir, to make the connection between our data platform
and real-time dashboards with multiple live subscribers. High quality standards were applied and we 
took care of problems like duplicates and backpressure.
* Performed as On-Call Engineer for API-Gateway and Talkdesk ID, the two entry points of Talkdesk. Created and
tuned a few metrics, and wrote detailed and blameless post-mortems after the incidents, that were useful to make
improvements in the affected systems.
* Evaluated candidates challenges and performed technical interviews with direct impact in the team. I was also
responsible for coaching and mentoring newcomers in the team, by providing high value deep dive sessions around
our core systems. Newcomers were ready to contribute after the first week on the job with pair and mob programming sessions.
* Started a weekly user group around computer science papers, mostly an in-house version of the Papers We Love meetup.
It was great to see more people reading papers after each session.

### Farfetch (late 2017-early 2018)

* Worked closely with the architecture team to design and implement
a cross-company strategy to mask sensitive personal information backed
by Apache Kafka and Cassandra.
* Extracted and scaled a legacy application to thousands of users
through small endpoints that were exposed on a public API, designed
with a CQRS architecture.
* Increased the test depth and coverage of a core and highly-available service that
it is being used by the customer service department to perform direct sales.

### Jumia Services (2016-2017)

* Designed, developed and tested highly concurrent and multi-timezone
microservices using mainly Java, Spring Boot and Netflix OSS.
* Designed a solution to preserve the message processing ordering within
multiple RabbitMQ consumers to improve the consistency of our microservices.
* Handled several concurrency issues in our data-intensive applications
that dropped the error rate to nearly 0%.
* Defined a new strategy to release multiple modules that performed 10
times faster than the previous one.
* Designed and developed an end-to-end testing framework that dropped by
almost 100% the time needed to test a full new feature.
* Massively increased the testing coverage of our microservices through
unit, integration, contract and end-to-end testing

### Super Bock Group (2015)

* Responsible for building multiple re-usable components for websites based on the
[Carlsberg Pegasus](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hpmPN4-ao3k) project, mainly
[Super Bock](superbock.pt) and [Agua das Pedras](aguadaspedras.pt), improving the
time-to-market significantly.

### Orbcom (2013-2014)

* Built several e-commerce solutions for multiple clients.
* Migrated legacy solutions to use a new stack and improved their performance and time-to-market.
* I was responsible for sharing, mentoring, and training colleagues with the new stack to spread
the knowledge amoung the whole team.
