I'm a software engineer living in the beautiful city of [Porto](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Porto), Portugal.

I am strongly interested in distributed systems, databases, programming languages, and stream processing.

I have over ten years of experience in the industry, focusing on distributed systems, the JVM, and the BEAM.

Currently, I work as a Senior Software Engineer (IV) at [PagerDuty](https://pagerduty.com), primarily on the Ingestion
Platform and as part of the Java Core Team. Before a significant reorganization, I was a technical lead
on [Operations Console](https://support.pagerduty.com/main/docs/operations-console), a real-time incident dashboard.

I am an avid reader and enjoy exploring computer science papers. Before the COVID-19 pandemic, I led the Porto chapter
of [Papers We Love](https://paperswelove.org/chapter/porto).

I have given several talks and had the opportunity to speak
in [Poland](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AEtXHTGEweg&pp=ugMICgJlbhABGAHKBQ9vcmRlcGRldiBwZWRybyA%3D)
and [Colombia](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWLcRZUo9Mc&pp=ugMICgJlbhABGAHKBQ9vcmRlcGRldiBwZWRybyA%3D).

Additionally, I have worked at companies such
as [Rows](https://rows.com), [Talkdesk](https://www.talkdesk.com), [Farfetch](https://www.farfetch.com),
and [Jumia](https://group.jumia.com).

Although I started a [Master's program in Software Engineering](https://fe.up.pt/estudar/mesw/?lang=en) at the Faculdade
de Engenharia da Universidade do Porto, I ultimately decided to drop out. (Take my advice: don't do it!)
