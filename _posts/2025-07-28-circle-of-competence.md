Sometimes I catch myself second-guessing a critical technical decision or feeling overwhelmed on a project I don’t fully understand. That’s usually a sign that I’m operating beyond my **circle of competence**.

For me, that circle isn’t just what I know on paper—it’s where I’m fluent. It’s where I move fast, trust my instincts, and know the difference between what’s knowable and what’s just uncertainty I can’t eliminate. When I can name my unknowns with confidence, I know I’m *in the zone*. That’s one of the biggest edges you get as a senior engineer: **sharper decisions, fewer unforced errors, more trust from your team**.

## Keeping the Circle Sharp

A circle of competence is a living thing, built slowly through years of experience, a few hard-won mistakes, and relentless curiosity. For me, it starts with being honest about where people already rely on me. That’s usually the core. Then I try to name three things: **what I know well, what I know I don’t know, and what’s just unknowable**. If I can clearly name all three, I know I’m inside my circle. If I can’t, that’s an edge worth exploring.

One way I keep that circle sharp is by returning to **fundamentals**. Trends fade fast. Fundamentals don’t. I often revisit the basics of my domain, such as the *CAP theorem* for distributed systems or *queuing theory* for performance, and rederive them as if I were explaining them to a beginner. It keeps my foundation solid even as tools and frameworks shift.

Growth doesn’t happen by accident, either. I block time each week to dig into something new: reading papers, exploring source code, or hacking together quick throwaway prototypes. Once a year, I take on one project that truly challenges me. And I share what I learn—whether through design documents, talks, or blog posts—because *teaching forces clarity and multiplies your impact*.

I’ve also started *treating myself like a system*. After every project, I log my assumptions, key decisions, and outcomes. Did the latency drop I expected actually happen? If not, why? Over time, patterns emerge—such as my tendency to underestimate complexity in certain areas. Tracking that stuff **compounds into better judgment**.

One thing I’ve learned the hard way is that **seniority can create blind spots**. Every quarter, I ask peers what they see: “What am I missing? Where am I weak?” It’s uncomfortable, but I’ve never done it without learning something useful. And before chasing shiny new skills, I check whether they actually help the team and company—*faster, safer, cheaper*.

## Making It Stick

None of this works if the ego takes over. **Ego-driven choices create blind spots**; competence-driven ones create leverage. When something fails, I try to *treat it as data*: what went wrong, why, and what I’ll do differently next time. The key is to **keep failures small enough to survive and continue learning**.

The way I make it all stick is simple. Every month, I take a few minutes to reflect on recent decisions and mistakes—what worked, what didn’t—and write it down. Each quarter, I check in with peers and look for patterns. Once a year, I revisit fundamentals and challenge myself with a single complex project. No fancy tools required—just a notebook, a document, or a calendar reminder. **The habit is what matters**.

## The Payoff

For me, the payoff has been tremendous. A clear circle of competence enables me to make **faster, smarter decisions, avoid overconfidence traps, grow in ways that truly matter to the organization, and scale my impact** through teaching and collaboration. It doesn’t happen overnight, but it *compounds over time*.

Not sure where to start? Write down one strength, one gap, and one genuine unknown. That’s your foundation. Start there today and keep at it—it pays off for years to come.
