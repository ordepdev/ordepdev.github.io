## Papers, Love, and Meetup.com

This should be titled _"Why I didn't renewed Papers We Love @ Porto subscription on Meetup.com"_ but you get the idea. Last August I didn't pay for another half year subscription to have a placeholder for this scientific community; you might wonder why.

```
Yikes! Your Meetup Group will shut down in 48 hours!

Hi Pedro Tavares,

Nobody has stepped up yet to become the new Organizer of Papers We Love @ Porto. There are only 48 hours left before the group is shut down and removed from Meetup.com forever.

As the new Organizer you get to:

    Determine the future direction of the Meetup Group
    Change the name, description, group colors, etc...
    Schedule Meetups
    Decide who can join the group
    Make it whatever you and your members want!
```

Let's dissect what I get to do as an Organizer besides, well, organize:

* _Determine the future direction of the group_, which is the same as when I started - promote a slot where Porto'[s](s) tech companies and universities could chat about interesting computer science topics.
* _Change the name, description, and group colors_ - not going to happen.
* _Schedule Meetups_ - oh, yeah, the critical one.
* _Decide who can join the group_ - there are no gatekeepers around here, the group is open to everyone!
* _Make it whatever you and your members want_ - hmm, a place to share and talk about interesting computer science topics!

None of these bullets actually convinced me to stay around this platform for another six months mainly because they doesn't cover the bad things that come with the full package - bad pricing and _RSVPs_.

## Pricing and RSVPs

The _coolest_ thing about this platform is that we're able to create a brand new community, make it discoverable around the locals, schedule some events, and get the full list of attendees.

The truth is that we're able to do all of this for free and without getting upset about the # of RSVPs vs the # of people that actually show up for the events - yeah, that's the saddest thing of this platform, people who continuously RSVP and never show up (come on folks, what are you doing?).

I may sound a bit extreme but without sponsorships (I don't want them, seriously.) and as a solo organizer I'm really not interested in paying a fee for a slot in a website that enables people to interact via _false_ RSVPs.

It would be cool if they provide free plans for communities that don't rely on any kind of sponsorship and don't use the platform to expose the brand behind it but it seems that's not an option.

## Some stats from the community so far

* 10 successful events
* 15 amazing talks
* 194 followers on twitter
* 438 members on meetup

## Plans for the future

I'll rely solo on [@pwlporto](https://twitter.com/pwlporto) twitter account to announce future events and cool papers that we should all read. It might be a daunting task to reach all the interested ones because not everyone has a twitter account but it's free after all!
