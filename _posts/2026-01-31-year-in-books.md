I read a lot this year. Honestly, it was my best year for reading so far with [31 books in total](https://www.goodreads.com/review/list/68457745-pedro-tavares?ref=nav_mybooks&shelf=read). The big shift for me was actually diving into fiction, which isn't something I usually do, but it ended up being exactly what I needed to balance out the technical deep dives.

## The Heavy Hitters (5 Stars)

These are the ones that actually shifted my perspective and earned their shelf space:

- **War and Peace (Leo Tolstoy)**: I finally tackled the beast. It’s not just "historical fiction"; it’s a masterclass in how individual lives are swept up in the tides of history. It makes modern "crises" feel a lot smaller and serves as a humbling reminder that the "Great Men" of history are often just passengers to larger systemic forces.

- **The Staff Engineer's Path (Tanya Reilly)**: This is the map I wish I’d had two years ago. Essential reading for anyone navigating the transition from "writing code" to "owning outcomes." It’s a definitive guide for fixing organizations with the same rigor we use to fix systems.

- **Human Acts (Han Kang)**: Brutal, poetic, and necessary. A look into the Gwangju uprising that stays with you long after you close the book. It’s a masterclass in perspective and a reminder of the human cost behind political shifts.

## Money, Macro, and Rust

I spent a lot of time this year trying to understand why the financial plumbing is leaking and how to build digital alternatives.

- **Broken Money (Lyn Alden) & How Countries Go Broke (Ray Dalio)**: These two are a perfect pairing. Alden explains how the ledger actually works, while Dalio provides the 500-year historical lens to show that we've seen this movie before.

- **Building Bitcoin in Rust (Lukas Hozda)**: There’s no better way to understand a protocol than trying to implement it in a language that forces you to care about memory safety. Implementing the UTXO model while fighting the borrow checker is high friction, but high reward.

- **Liberalismo (Carlos Guimarães Pinto) & Antes do 25 de Abril (António Costa Santos)**: Reading these together provided a great bridge between Portugal's historical constraints and its future possibilities. It’s the classic battle between central planning and decentralized opportunity.

## Dystopia vs. Reality

I went through a dystopian phase with **Huxley (Brave New World)**, **Zamyatin (We)**, and **Bradbury (Fahrenheit 451)**.

My take is that **We (2 stars)** felt like a rough draft for the others. It’s historically important, but it felt like a prototype that didn't quite reach production.

Paired with **Jonathan Haidt’s The Anxious Generation**, these classics felt less like fiction and more like current affairs. We are living through the "Great Rewiring" and Haidt’s data on the collapse of play-based childhood is basically a massive memory leak we're only just starting to debug.
