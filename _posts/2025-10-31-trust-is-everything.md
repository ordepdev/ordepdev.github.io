Trust isn't something you can demand. It's built slowly, through actions
that match your words. Every time you follow through, you make a small deposit
in someone's mental *trust account*. Over time, those deposits compound into
confidence, and once you've earned that, things start to move faster, easier,
and with less friction.

## How trust is built

Be reliable. The simplest way to build trust is to keep your promises. Show
up when you say you will. Show up when people need you. Deliver when it matters.
Many small acts done consistently beat sporadic heroic moves. That consistency
becomes reputation, and reputation opens doors.

Show care and context. People trust those who think beyond themselves. Explain
your reasoning, consider how your actions might affect others, and make sure people
understand what to expect from you. This type of clarity builds confidence.

Be open. Admitting what you don't know, or when you've made a mistake, doesn't
weaken trust as you might think. It's quite the opposite. Doing so, shows honesty
and invites collaboration. People respect truth more than perfection.

Prove it. I believe that talk is cheap. Show something working. Make your results
reproducible and your process transparent. Reliability matters more than brilliance
that can't be proven or repeated.

## Why trust matters

Trust gives you the **benefit of the doubt**. When people trust you, they don't assume
the worst if something goes wrong, making it easier to take risks, move quickly,
and create together. Without trust, every action needs double checking, every word
needs proof, and progress slows down.

Trust scales. Teams, markets, and societies rely on trust. When trust is high, we
can build on promises, and when it's low, we fall back on control. Trust reduces the
cost of coordination.

But **trust is fragile**. It takes time to build and an instant to lose. One bad choice
can wipe out years of credibility.

## How trust breaks

Trust breaks when people can't count on you. When you miss deadlines, when you shift
goals, or when you cut corners, it shows unreliability. That belief that "you'll deliver"
slowly starts to fade.

It breaks when things feel hidden. Opaque work, or unverified claims make others
nervous and force them to double-check everything. The more they have to verify, the
less they trust you.

And it breaks when you violate expectations. Changing the rules after the fact, or
pretending that nothing happened damages trust more than failure itself.

## How trust is rebuilt

Keep your promises again, but this time with extra visibility. Break work into small,
clear steps, make sure you deliver each one of them, and that someone can verify
what you did.

Tell the truth early and often. Admit what went wrong and what you'll do differently
next time. Don't hide. The moment you get defensive, trust slips further away.

Design for trust. Make it hard to hide mistakes and easy to catch problems early. The
goal isn't to completely avoid failure, but to make it survivable.

Earn back the benefit of the doubt. That's something you can't simply ask for it; you
have to prove you deserve it. Over time, consistent honesty and delivery shrink the
need for oversight.

## On being trusted

Trusted people get more freedom and higher-stakes work because others know they'll
deliver. They help others succeed, which makes everyone want to work with them again.

In the end, the only real strategy to be trusted is to be reliable, honest, and clear,
over and over again. Do that long enough, and trust becomes the default between you 
and everyone who matters.
