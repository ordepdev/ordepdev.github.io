You want to change everything and everyone around you, not just because you want to - because you believe it's the _best_ thing to do.

If you're like me, working with computers daily for an organization with one or more products, you have to work under a certain amount of _rules_.

Some of them were in place way before you joined the organization.

Some of them were set up during your tenure.

You don't agree with all of them, and that's fine since we can't please everyone.

And you'll fight for your **beliefs**, either it's a technical, cultural, or behavioral matter.

Sadly, **you'll lose** most of the _battles_.

Not because your _beliefs_ suck.

Not because the organization won't benefit from them.

You'll lose because **you're against someone** else's _beliefs_.

I know you want to (continue to) work remotely.

I know you want to do some functional programming.

I know you want to focus on infrastructure and performance problems.

Still, it's **not going to happen there**.

Have a deep breath, **stop fighting and embrace it**.

You still have the choice to leave and move on!
